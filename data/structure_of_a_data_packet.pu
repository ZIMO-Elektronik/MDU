  :>=10 one bits;
  note left
  A MDU data packet is identified and synchronized to the byte boundaries with a
  sequence of one bits. Command stations must send at least 14 one bits in a row.
  Decoders must be able to receive a packet with â‰¥10 one bits.
  end note
repeat while (Bit == 0) is (false) not (true)

repeat
  :8 data bits;
  note left
  The packet start bit is a zero bit immediately following the sync bits. The
  start bit completes the synchronization and indicates to the decoder that the
  following bits belong to the first byte of the packet. 8 bits of user data
  follow, the meaning of which depends on the command package.
  end note
repeat while (Bit == 1) is (false) not (true)

:Ackreq Bits 0-1;
note left
The first two acknowledgment bits can be used by command stations to carry out a
reference current measurement. No ackbits may be sent during this time.
end note

:Ackreq Bits 2-4 (channel 1);
note left
Channel 1 can be used by decoders to report back transmission and checksum
errors.
end note

:Ackreq Bit 5;

:Ackreq Bits 6-8 (channel 2);
note left
Channel 2 can be used by decoders to report back data. The exact meaning of the
acknowledgement can be found in the detailed description of the respective
command packages.
